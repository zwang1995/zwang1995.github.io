Today I delivered an **Oral Presentation** about our recent work on "**[Computer-Aided Molecular and Process Design](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2023/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/663111)**" at **2023 AIChE Annual Meeting** in Orlando, Florida, United States.

This work was recently published in **_AIChE Journal_** titled "**[Data-Driven Integrated Design of Solvents and Extractive Distillation Processes](https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.18236)**".
