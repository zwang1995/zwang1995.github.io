Today I presented a **Poster** about our recent work on "**Computer-Aided Molecular Design**" 
at **33rd European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-33)** in Athens, Greece.

This work was published in **_Computer Aided Chemical Engineering_** 
titled "**[Molecular property targeting for optimal solvent design in extractive distillation processes](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-443-15274-0.50199-2)**".
