I delivered a **Keynote Oral Presentation** featuring our recent research in **Computer-Aided Molecular Design** at the **32nd European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-32)** in Toulouse, France.

This work was published in **_Computer Aided Chemical Engineering_** 
titled "**[A novel machine learning-based optimization approach for the molecular design of solvents](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-95879-0.50247-2)**".
